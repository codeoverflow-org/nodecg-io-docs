First you'll need an installation of nodecg-io. Please refer to the installation guide and create a development installation. The cli asks you whether you want to clone the documentation. It's highly recommended that you do that and update the documentation as you add new services or features. To be able to create Pull Requests you should fork the corresponding repositories and add them as a remote (update url for e.g. documentation repository): git remote add fork https://github.com/ [ YOUR_USERNAME ] /nodecg-io.git Then you can create a new branch, do your changes, create commits and publish the branch to your fork using the following command: git push fork my-branch Build VS Code In Visual Studio Code you can start the build task with Ctrl + Shift + B ( CMD + Shift + B on macOS). The incremental builder will do an initial full build. The watch builder will watch for file changes and compile those changes incrementally, giving you a fast, iterative coding experience. It will even stay running in the background if you close VS Code. You can resume it by starting the build task with Ctrl + Shift + B ( CMD + Shift + B ) again. ou can kill the build task by pressing Ctrl + D in the task terminal ( CMD + D ) on macOS. Errors and warnings will be shown in the status bar at the bottom left of the editor. You can view the error list using View | Errors and Warnings or pressing Ctrl + P and then ! ( CMD + P and ! on macOS) Terminal You can also use you terminal to build nodecg-io: cd path/to/nodecg-io npm run build To do a full rebuild instead of just an incremental build you can use npm run rebuild . The watch builder can be activated here too: cd path/to/nodecg-io npm run watch Note: Watching all packages requires a lot of RAM. Instead, you can watch just the packages you are actively working on e.g. npm run watch -- --scope nodecg-io-twitch-chat --scope twitch-chat . This will just spawn a watch process for the twitch-chat sample and service and require way less memory. Run To test the changes you simply need to start/restart nodecg. Adding dependencies to packages This project uses lerna to manage our monorepo, and most importantly link all our packages together. Because of linking you should not use npm install xyz --save to add dependencies because npm can't get the development version of internal packages like nodecg-io-core . Doing so will result in an error and break the link. Instead, you should edit the package.json directly using a text editor and the run npm run bootstrap in the repository root. Open a Pull Request Once you have implemented your feature or fixed a bug push it to your fork and start a Pull Request. Merge Upstream Changes Occasionally you will want to merge changes in the upstream repository (the official code repo) with your fork. cd path/to/nodecg-io git checkout master git pull https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/nodecg-io master Manage any merge conflicts, commit them, and then push them to your fork. You may also occasionally need to merge upstream master in a pull request. To do that make the above to update your local master, and then merge your local master into your PR branch. Where to Contribute After cloning and building the repo, check out the issues list . Issues labeled help wanted are good issues to submit a PR for. Issues labeled good first issue are great candidates to pick up if you are in the code for the first time. If you are contributing significant changes, please discuss with the assignee of the issue first before starting to work on the issue. Suggestions We're also interested in your feedback.

Create your bundle using the nodecg-io cli Automatically generating a bundle that uses nodecg-io requires that you have the nodecg-io cli installed. A guide on how to do this is inside the install guide . Also note that this currently only works when you have installed a release version, not development versions. To start run this command while being inside your nodecg installation: nodecg-io generate This will ask you a couple details about your bundle like name, description and used services. Most questions have a reasonable default that you can choose if you don't care or are not sure about the asked thing. After finishing the prompt the cli will generate your bundle, install dependencies and, if you have chosen TypeScript, compile the generated code. Test it Start NodeCG and make sure that the bundle gets loaded successfully and it is displayed in the nodecg-io dashboard with all service dependencies. Modify it After that you should edit the extension/index.ts or extension/index.js depending on your chosen language to do something useful. You can start by updating the onAvailable callbacks. Note: If you need to access another service inside the callback of a onAvailable call you can use otherService.getClient() to get the client or undefined if it is not set. Further steps A couple of steps you may want to do after generating a bundle: Create a git repository for you bundle (a .gitignore is automatically generated for you) and push it to a git platform of your choice Add a open source license , don't forget it to also add it to the package.json file Add code formatters and linting tools like prettier and ESLint Add a README that explains what your bundle does and how it can be used Share it!

If you are lucky and used the same library as we do for the service you want to migrate, nodecg-io is a drop-in replacement just doing authentication and configuration. If you have used another library you'll have to do a little more work to migrate to the library that our service uses. In that case make sure that the migration is worth the effort. You can use nodecg-io for one service and use your own library of choice for other services if you like to. Install nodecg-io-core The first thing you need to do is to install nodecg-io-core . You can do this simply using this npm command: npm install nodecg-io-core Import requireService Now that you have nodecg-io-core installed in your bundle you can import the requireService function that it exposes: TypeScript/ES Modules import { requireService } from \"nodecg-io-core\" ; CommonJS const requireService = require ( \"nodecg-io-core\" ). requireService ; Import Service type (TypeScript only) If you're using TypeScript you'll also need to install the package of the service that you want to use. You need it to be able to import its type for typesafety. This example uses twitch-chat as an example but you can just replace it with the name of the service you need. TypeScript npm install nodecg-io-twitch-chat import { TwitchChatServiceClient } from \"nodecg-io-twitch-chat\" ; Note: You can get the name of the type by using autocomplete in your editor or by looking it up in the service sample. Require the service Now you can finally tell nodecg-io that you want to get access to a service using the requireService function. You'll have to pass your nodecg instance which is used to identify your bundle and the name of the service you want. In case of TypeScript you'll also need to provide the type of the service. TypeScript const twitchChat = requireService < TwitchChatServiceClient > ( nodecg , \"twitch-chat\" ); JavaScript const twitchChat = requireService ( nodecg , \"twitch-chat\" ); Accessing the service client Using onAvailable and onUnavailable handlers You can setup handlers that are executed when the user assigns a service instance to your bundle, removes the assignment or when the service client got updated in some way. Handlers added with onAvailable will get called if there was a change and you got a client: // This is the variable with the return value of requireService(). // You may want to change the variable name for the service you are using. twitchChat . onAvailable ( client => { nodecg . log . info ( \"Client was set\" ); // You can use the passed client in here to e.g. setup handlers on the client }); onAvailable is especially useful to add event handlers to clients. E.g. if you want to react to donations or chat messages you can add event handlers for these here. Handlers added with onUnavailable will get called if your bundle was not assigned a service instance or if there was an error in service client creation: twitchChat . onUnavailable (() => { nodecg . log . info ( \"Client was unset\" ); }); Using getClient Instead of callbacks you can also get access to the client directly: const twitchChatClient = twitchChat . getClient (); getClient will return the client if your bundle has an assigned service instance that has produced an service client without error and will return undefined otherwise.

Required Applications You'll need the following tools: Git Node.JS v12.0.0 or newer Npm 7.0.0 or newer NodeCG 1.4.0 or newer (1.7.0 or higher recommended) Native Build Tools Some services depend on packages that require native build tools. You ONLY need to install these if you want to use a service that depends on native modules or if you want to install a development version. The services that require these include StreamDeck, Midi and Serial. Please note that this list might not be up to date. Here's how to install the native build tools on the most popular operating systems, if you need them: Windows For Windows, you'll need the Visual Studio Build Tools, if you have Visual Studio installed you should already have them. If you don't have Visual Studio just install the Visual Studio Build Tools by running the following command as an Administrator : npm install -g windows-build-tools Linux For Linux, you'll need a C++ compiler and some other packages. On Ubuntu/Debian based operating systems run the following command: sudo apt install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev libasound2-dev libudev-dev For other linux distros you'll need the corresponding packages, just search on the internet how the packages are named for your specific distro. MacOS For macOS, you'll need the Xcode command line tools. To install them run the following command: xcode-select --install Install the nodecg-io cli Install the nodecg-io cli using the following command: npm install -g nodecg-io-cli Note: If you are running on linux, you may need to use sudo if your npm installation uses a non-writeable path (default on Ubuntu apt packages, does usually not apply to installs using nvm ) Install nodecg-io using the nodecg-io cli With the nodecg-io cli installed you can run this command inside a nodecg installation to install nodecg-io: nodecg-io install You will get a prompt which asks you which version you want to install. By selecting a actual version (e.g. 0.1 ) you create a production install that downloads the required packages from npm and setups a npm workspace to install all dependencies. Here you can choose which services you want to install. By selecting development you create a development install that clones the nodecg-io git repo and builds everything from scratch. We only recommend a dev install if you are sure that you want to contribute to nodecg-io. Here you always must install all services. For starters we recommend using the latest non-development version. nodecg-io will always be installed into a nodecg-io/ directory inside your nodecg installation so that your bundles and all bundles from nodecg-io are separated. The cli will add this path to the loaded bundles in your nodecg configuration automatically, you don't need to worry about it. If you want to every change your nodecg-io installation to add/remove a service or change the version, you can always re-run nodecg-io install . If a nodecg-io installation is found its options will be preselected in the prompt. Re-running nodecg-io install will also update all packages to the latest patch version, if you have a production installation, and pull the repository and rebuild, if you have a development installation. Start nodecg When starting nodecg you should see that all nodecg-io related bundles should be loaded and that you can you can now access nodecg-io in your nodecg dashboard. Now you can either install a already existing bundle that uses nodecg-io, create a new bundle or integrate an existing bundle .
