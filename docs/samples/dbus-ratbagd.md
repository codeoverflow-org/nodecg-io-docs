## Using the DBus ratbagd sample bundle

The dbus-ratbagd example bundle in `samples/dbus-ratbagd` demonstrates how to access all devices supported by ratbagd. Here is a guide to how to get it working.

### Prerequisites

-   Working NodeCG & nodecg-io installation
-   [ratbagd](https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag)

### Configure the DBus ratbagd sample bundle

1. Start nodecg with nodecg-io installed. The dbus-ratbagd bundle is currently part of it so it should also be loaded.

2. Go to the `nodecg-io` tab in the nodecg dashboard.

3. Login using your password. If this is your first run, then enter the password with which you want to encrypt your configurations and credentials.

4. Create a new dbus service instance using the left upper menu.

5. Configure the dbus service

   There should not be any additional configuration needed for the dbus service. Just enter an empty json object like this:

    ```json
    {}
    ```

   After entering it, click save.

   _Note:_ If you don't see monaco on the right, try reloading the page.

6. Set the created dbus service instance to the service dependency of the dbus-ratbagd bundle.

   Select the dbus-ratbagd bundle and the dbus service in the left bottom menu and then select the service instance that should be used by the dbus-ratbagd sample bundle (in this case the name of the previously created dbus instance).

7. Check the nodecg logs

   You should see an error or a success message and a list of connected device names
