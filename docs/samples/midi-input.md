## Using the midi-input sample bundle

The midi-input example bundle in `samples/midi-input` demonstrates the ability
to read data from a midi device.

### Prerequisites

You will need a working `nodecg-io` installation. If you have non yet take a
look at [installation guide](../getting_started/install.md). You may need to
install this bundle, so take a look at the
[“Try an included sample”](../getting_started/try_example_bundle.md)-Guide. It
will also tell you how to log in and how to use the GUI.

**You also need:**

-   A midi device that can be connected to your computer

### Configure the midi-input sample bundle

1.  In NodeCG, create a new midi-input service instance.

2.  Enter your device information:

    ```json
    {
        "device": "name"
    }
    ```

    After entering it, click save.

    !!! NOTE

        A script is provided to list all inputs and outputs. It can be run
        from the sample directory `samples/midi-input` using the command
        `npm run list`. The devices should be listed with their device names
        and some other stuff.

        Under Linux this looks for example like this:

        ```plain
        nanoKONTROL2:nanoKONTROL2 MIDI 1 28:0
        ```

3.  Set the sample's (`midi-input`) dependency to be the newly created service
    instance (of type `midi-input`).
4.  Check the NodeCG logs:

    You should see an error or a success message and all midi messages that are
    sent by the device that is configured.
