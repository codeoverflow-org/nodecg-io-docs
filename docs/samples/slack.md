## Using the Slack sample bundle

The Slack example bundle in `samples/slack-post` demonstrates the ability to
list all channels into the console and sends a message to a channel which you
have to configure to your channel ID.

### Prerequisites

You will need a working `nodecg-io` installation. If you have non yet take a
look at [installation guide](../getting_started/install.md). You may need to
install this bundle, so take a look at the
[“Try an included sample”](../getting_started/try_example_bundle.md)-Guide. It
will also tell you how to log in and how to use the GUI.

**You also need:**

-   a Slack Bot token

!!! NOTE

    If you don't have such a token yet, you can create your own app with
    token on [this](https://app.slack.com/apps-manage/) page.

### Configure the Slack sample bundle

1. In NodeCG, create a new slack service instance.

2. Enter your Slack app token:

    ```json
    {
        "token": "your-token-goes-here"
    }
    ```

    After entering it, click save.

3. Set the sample's (`slack-post`) dependency to be the newly created service
   instance (of type `slack`).

4. Check the NodeCG logs:

    You should see an error or a login message.
