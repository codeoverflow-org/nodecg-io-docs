## Using the twitter sample bundle

The Twitter timeline bundle retrieves some of the latest tweets from _skate702_ and printing them to your console.

### Prerequisites

-   Working NodeCG & nodecg-io installation
-   An [app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and their following keys and tokens
    -   The _API key_ here **oauthConsumerKey**
    -   The _API secret key_ here **oauthConsumerSecret**
    -   The _Access token_ here **oauthToken**
    -   The _Access token secret_ here **oauthTokenSecret**

_Note:_ You will need a Twitter developer account (<https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access>) to get the necessary keys and tokens.

### Configure the sample bundle

1. Start nodecg with nodecg-io installed. The twitter-timeline bundle is currently part of it, so it should also be loaded.

2. Go to the `nodecg-io` tab in the nodecg dashboard.

3. Login using your password. If this is your first run, then enter the password with which you want to encrypt your configurations and credentials.

4. Create a new twitter service instance using the left upper menu.

5. Enter credentials for twitter.

    The created instance should be automatically selected, if not select it in the upper left menu. Enter your Twitter keys and tokens in monaco (the text-editor on the right) in this format:

    ```json
    {
        "oauthConsumerKey": "<API key>",
        "oauthConsumerSecret": "<API secret key>",
        "oauthToken": "<Access token>",
        "oauthTokenSecret": "<Access token secret>"
    }
    ```

    After entering it, click save.

    _Note:_ If you don't see monaco on the right, try reloading the page.

6. Set the created twitter service instance to the service dependency of the twitter-timeline bundle.

    Select the twitter-timeline bundle and the twitter service in the left bottom menu and then select the service instance that should be used by the twitter-timeline bundle (in this case the name of the previously created twitter instance).

7. Check the nodecg logs

    You should see an error or a success message and up to 50 Twitter messages tweeted by the user that is hardcoded in [samples/twitter-timeline/extension/index.ts](/samples/twitter-timeline/extension/index.ts) as `screen_name`.

## Need to know for creating your own twitter bundle

### A little description of the twitter client and it's usage

-   The client implements the different [API endpoints](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index) with two functions

    ```typescript
      client.get("<get endpoint name>", params, callback)
      client.post("<post endpoint name>", params, callback)

      // Instead of callbacks it can be used with promises
      client
        .get("statuses/user_timeline", {screen_name: "skate702"})
        .then((tweets) => /* Do something with the tweets */)
        .catch((error) => /* Handle error */);

      // Or async and await as well
      try {
        const tweets = await client.get("statuses/user_timeline", {screen_name: "skate702"});
        // Do something with the tweets
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
      }
    ```
