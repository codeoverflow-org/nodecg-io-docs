nodecg-io has a steadily growing and improving documentation. We are using
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to describe the content and
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for the deployment to the webpage
(<https://nodecg.io>). If you want to get to know the standard Markdown syntax,
take a look at this [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). We also use many
plugins, so you may take a look at a curated list of
[examples](docs_markdown.md) of the extended syntax.

## Clone this repo

If you installed the development version nodecg-io with the CLI, you may have
already cloned the `nodecg-io-docs` repository into the `docs` folder inside
nodecg-io directory. Then you will have to fork the official repo and add your
fork as a remote:

```shell
git remote add <name> (https://github.com/<your-user-name>/nodecg-io-docs.git)
```

Else clone your fork into a desired directory with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/nodecg-io-docs.git
```

## Repository structure

|-- .github ................ CI workflows
|-- .vscode ................ VS Code specific configs
|-- docs ................... All files included in the documentation
|   |-- assets ................ other files used (images)
|   |-- contribute ............ Section on development and documentation
|   |-- getting_started ....... Section on first use

|-- .markdownlint.json ..... markdownlint config file
|-- .prettierrc.json ....... prettier (formatter) config file

```

## Install dependencies to use the preview

You will need a Python 3 installed. You will also need to install `mkdocs` with
pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can serve the local version with:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

Now you can access it in your browser under <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.

## Using VS Code

### Extensions

For the folks out there who are using VS Code to edit these documents you can
use the recommended extensions of this workspace by using the `@recommended `
filter in the extensions panel. Those extensions will format (`Prettier`) and
lint (`markdownlint`) the markdown files, and live check many typos and grammar
(`LTeX`). Also, the built-in preview will parse more of our used syntax.

### Tasks

!!! NOTE

    You will need prettier and markdownlint installed in your path.

You may also benefit from the preconfigured serve task. It can be accessed with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on macOS). This will format and lint the files
and then serve them to you.
