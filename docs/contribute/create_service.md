# Create a service integration

This guide helps you to create a service integration such as *twitch-chat* or *discord*

## Find a javascript library

Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and look whether there's already a package that wraps around the API of your service. If there's no such package you need to create one yourself. This process is not described here.

## Create a package

From here you will have to replace:  

* `YourServiceName` to your service's name in [PascalCase](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md#class).  
* `yourServiceName` to your service's name in [carmelCase](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md#variable-and-function).   
* `your-service-name` to your service's name with only lowercase and hyphens ( `-` ) for example: ws-server.

Now you need to create a package. You should call it `nodecg-io-your-service-name`.

First create a directory with that name put file called `package.json` into it.

Put the following into it: 

```json
{
  "name": "nodecg-io-your-service-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "<Short description what is possible with your service.>",
  "homepage": "",
  "author": {
    "name": "<Your name>",
    "url": "<Your github profile url>"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "watch": "tsc -w"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "",
    "nodecg-bundle"
  ],
  "nodecg": {
    "compatibleRange": "^1.1.1",
    "bundleDependencies": {
      "nodecg-io-core": "0.1.0"
    }
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^13.13.5",
    "nodecg": "^1.6.1",
    "typescript": "^3.8.3"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "nodecg-io-core": "0.1.0",
    "<the package you found in step 1>": "<the packages version you wan't to use>"
  }
}
```

Next you need to put a file called `tsconfig.json` next to your `package.json`. The `tsconfig.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.common.json"
}
```

Now run `npm install` in the repository root.

## Create a configuration schema

Next create a file called `your-service-name-schame.json`. This is a json schema file that indicates how the configuration for your service should be structured. If you need help here take a look at [this](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) online resource and the schema-files of the other service implementations.

## Create the service

Create a file called `index.ts` in a folder called `extension` inside your services directory. You can then paste the following code and fill in your code instead of the comments.

```typescript
// TODO: Rename all occurences of "YourServiceName" in PascalCase
// TODO: Rename all occurences of "yourServiceName" in carmelCase
// TODO: Rename all occurences of "your-service-name" with only lowercase and hyphens ( - )

import { NodeCG } from "nodecg/types/server";
import { ServiceProvider } from "nodecg-io-core/extension/types";
import { emptySuccess, success, error, Result } from "nodecg-io-core/extension/utils/result";
import { ServiceBundle } from "nodecg-io-core/extension/serviceBundle";
// TODO: Replace the "fake" service class with that found on npm etc.
import { ServiceClass} from "./";

interface YourServiceNameServiceConfig {
    // TODO Fill in the values from your json schema here. The json
    // schema will load into an instance  of this.
}

export interface YourServiceNameServiceClient {
    // This interface is exposed to bundles. Make shure it's no longer
    // possible to access the login credentials from here
	// TODO: class of the package from step 1 that should be exposed to bundles [needs to be replaced];
	getRawClient(): ServiceClass;
}

module.exports = (nodecg: NodeCG): ServiceProvider<YourServiceNameServiceClient> | undefined => {
    const yourServiceName = new YourServiceNameService(nodecg, "your-service-name", __dirname, "../your-service-name-schema.json");
    return yourServiceName.register();
};

class YourServiceNameService extends ServiceBundle<YourServiceNameServiceConfig, YourServiceNameServiceClient> {
  async validateConfig(config: <YourServiceNameServiceConfig): Promise<Result<void>> {
    // TODO You can validate your config here. If this gets called, the schema is correct.
    // You should for example check whether oauth keys are valid and servers are online here
    // If everything is good return 'emptySuccess()'
    // If an error occurs return 'error(<The error message>)'
  }

  async createClient(config: <YourServiceNameServiceConfig): Promise<Result<YourServiceNameServiceClient>> {
    // TODO Here you should return a <Your service name>ServiceClient that is exposed to bundles.
    // If everything is good return 'success({
    //     getRawClient() {
    //         return <The raw client from the package from step 1>
    //     }
    // })'
    // If an error occurs return 'error(<The error message>)'
  }

  stopClient(client: YourServiceNameServiceClient): void {
    // Here you shuld make shure you disconnect everything here (if possible).
  }
}
```

Now run `npm run build` in the repository root, start NodeCG and test your service out.

## Next steps

You could [create a sample bundle](create_sample.md) for your brand-new service.

If you don't do so, make sure you add a placeholder file called `<the services name>.md` in `docs/samples` in your fork of the documentation.
 
The file should look like this:
 
```markdown
<!-- Marker for build.py that there's no sample bundle. Remove this if you created one -->
## Using the <the services name> sample bundle

No sample bundle for service `<the services name>`.  
[You can help us and create one!](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/nodecg-io/blob/master/docs/docs/contribute.md)
```

Do not remove the marker in the first line until the bundle is implemented and don't forget to add this file to `mkdocs.yml`.
