**nodecg-io is a [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg)-bundle that implements Social Media API's in the NodeCG framework**

nodecg-io is the successor of
[ChatOverflow](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow). The aim of
this bundle is to simplify the code and expand the number of integrated
services. The main goal is to increase the number of supported APIs to save you
development time.
